Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
** An application load balancer to front end the application server
** An application load balancer to front end the dedicated prediction servers
* In the private subnets:
** EC2 Instances for:
*** Application Server
*** Model Management Server 
*** HA Pair of Exploratory Data Analysis Servers
*** HA (3 nodes) Data Backend running mongo and redis
*** HA Pair of Prediction Servers (For running model predictions real-time/batch)
*** Autoscaling (1 to 5 nodes) of worker nodes for machine learning
** Cloudwatch alarms for autoscaling based on load
** Non-public S3 Bucket for data storage and ingest operations
** HTTPS Option: Certificates in AWS Certificate Manager for Application Load Balancers
** HTTPS Option: Route53 Zone records if applicable
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
